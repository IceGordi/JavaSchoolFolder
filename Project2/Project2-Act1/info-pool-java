1. pool.java Peter the pool boy has a pool that needs additional water. He needs to add water to the pool from a garden hose connected to the homeowner's house. He needs to determine, given a rate of flow, how long it will take to fill the pool to the desired depth so he can tell the homeowner when to turn the hose off.
He needs to know how long it will take to fill the pool. Write a java program to help him. Name your file pool.java . Below, input taken from user is underlined.

To start:

(a) Perform two of these calculations by hand. You will use these answers to verify your program later.
(b) What should the types of the inputs be?
(c) Are there input values that don't make sense?
(d) What are the types of outputs?
(e) Will you need to do any rounding? If so, when?


 Pool length (feet):  40
  Pool width (feet):  20
  Additional depth desired (inches):  1
  Water fill rate (gal/min):  6.7
  Time:  01:14:26





  Calculations:

  	12 inches = 1 feet

  length * width = area feet^3
  length * width * height = volume feet^3

  fill rate = volume gal/min 
 

  1 feet^3 = 7.480543 gal

  time displayed in hours:minutes:seconds
